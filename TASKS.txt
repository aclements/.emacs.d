* Standardize keys for comment region and compile

* Make arrows automatically skip over basic-offset spaces to emulate
  tab-like motion

* Make compilation-mode better.  It should be able to scroll the
  output as it appears until the first error appears, then stay there.
  It should also go away automatically if no errors occur.
